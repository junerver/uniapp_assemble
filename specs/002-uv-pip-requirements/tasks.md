# Tasks: UV包管理工具迁移

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-uv-pip-requirements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (completed), spec.md (completed), research.md (completed), data-model.md (completed), contracts/ (completed)

**Tests**: Tests are not explicitly requested in the feature specification, so test tasks are OPTIONAL and marked as such.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: Repository root level (infrastructure migration)
- All configuration files should be at repository root or in specified directories
- Scripts should be placed in `scripts/` directory
- Documentation updates should follow existing structure

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: UV工具安装和基础配置

- [ ] T001 Install UV package manager globally in system
- [ ] T002 [P] Backup existing requirements.txt and pip configuration files
- [ ] T003 [P] Create migration scripts directory structure in `scripts/`
- [ ] T004 Create UV configuration template files (.uvrc, .uv/)
- [ ] T005 [P] Update .gitignore to include UV-specific patterns (uv.lock, .venv/, .uv-cache/)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: 核心配置迁移 - 阻塞所有用户故事实施

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T010 [P] Set up development dependencies separation in [project.optional-dependencies.dev]
- [ ] T011 Generate initial uv.lock file with `uv lock` command
- [ ] T012 [P] Create virtual environment with `uv venv` and validate dependency installation
- [ ] T013 [P] Update existing pyproject.toml to include UV configuration and tool settings

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - UV environment established and all dependencies successfully installed

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - 包管理工具标准化迁移 (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: 将项目从pip + requirements.txt迁移到uv + pyproject.toml系统，提升依赖安装速度和环境管理效率

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 → US2 → US3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Validates both US1 & US2 outcomes

### Within Each User Story

- Foundational configuration before implementation
- Core implementation before testing
- Validation and testing before completion
- Documentation before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Documentation and optimization tasks can run in parallel with implementation
- Testing tasks can be parallelized where possible

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (MVP Focus)

```bash
# Launch all configuration tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Complete pyproject.toml with full dependency list and tool configurations"
Task: "Validate all dependencies install correctly with UV in new environment"
Task: "Test UV virtual environment activation and dependency management"

# Launch all script tasks in parallel:
Task: "Create UV-based dependency management scripts in scripts/uv-dependencies.sh"
Task: "Update README.md with UV installation and setup instructions"
Task: "Create dependency update and maintenance procedures"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test UV migration independently
5. Deploy/demo core migration functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → UV environment ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Core migration)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (CI/CD integration)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Performance validation)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Task Count Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 62
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 5 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 8 tasks (CRITICAL)
- **Phase 3 (US1 - MVP)**: 12 tasks
- **Phase 4 (US2 - CI/CD)**: 13 tasks
- **Phase 5 (US3 - Validation)**: 12 tasks
- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: 12 tasks

### Parallelizable Tasks
- **Tasks marked [P]**: 48 tasks (77%)
- **Sequential dependencies**: 14 tasks (23%)

### MVP Scope (User Story 1)
- **Tasks for MVP**: 25 tasks (40% of total)
- **Estimated effort**: 1-2 weeks for single developer

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Focus on incremental delivery with validation checkpoints
- Performance testing and validation are critical for success metrics
- Ensure rollback procedures are in place before full migration
- Team training and documentation are essential for successful adoption
