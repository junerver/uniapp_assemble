# Specification Quality Checklist: UV包管理工具迁移

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [UV包管理工具迁移](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All validation items have passed. Specification is ready for the next phase: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Specification clearly defines the migration from pip + requirements.txt to uv + pyproject.toml
- User stories cover the complete migration workflow: standardization, toolchain integration, and performance validation
- Functional requirements address all aspects of the migration process
- Success criteria are measurable and focused on performance improvements and user experience
- Edge cases consider potential migration challenges and compatibility issues
